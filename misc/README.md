Gerber_DIP48_Inverter -- based on the not at all infamouse Denise 180, this is a generic universal DIP socket rotator which allows you to mount any sort of DIP48 chip or board inside a socket, the other way around. This is primarily useful for the first revision Amiga 1000's and the Indivision ECS. It may have other uses.

Gerber_Katra-v0.2 -- this swaps the endianness of the Buffee accelerator. This is the 4-layer version of the board.

Gerber_Katra-v0.3 -- this swaps the endianness of the Buffee accelerator. This is the 2-layer version of the board.
